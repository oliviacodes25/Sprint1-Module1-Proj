            <p>Jon Foreman became famous because of the band Switchfoot, 
              where he was lead singer and co-founder. Their style is rock. They are
              not Christian per say, but there is an element of faith in their songs. 
              One of their stepping stones to fame includes a song "Learning to Breathe"
              that was featured in the Mandy Moore film "A Walk to Remember."</p>

            <h2 id="unique">Unique Characteristics of the Band</h2>
            <p>An interesting thing about Jon Foreman and Switchfoot is they 
              have an unconventional style and outlook. They also came together as a 
              band through surfing. Jon sums it up this way: 
              "We all love to surf and have been surfing all our lives so to us, 
              the name made sense. To switch your feet means to take a new stance 
              facing the opposite direction. It's about change and movement, 
              a different way of approaching life and music." (Wikipedia) </p>

            <p>Another interesting thing about their music is that
              they are not overtly Christian, but their songs have deep spiritual meaning. 
              Jon Foreman is extremely honest in his music, and in real life he went through
              a faith crisis. An example of his vulnerability as he wrestled through his faith
              is a song called "Jesus I Have My Doubts," from one of his solo albums.
